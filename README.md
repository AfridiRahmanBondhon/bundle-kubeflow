# KubeFlow Bundle

This bundle deploys KubeFlow to a Juju k8s model.

KubeFlow consists of:

  * TensorFlow Hub, a JupyterHub for running interactive notebooks
    with TensorFlow libraries available

  * TensorFlow Dashboard, to manage TensorFlow jobs

  * TensorFlow Training, for training TensorFlow models

  * Ambassador, an API gateway for managing access to the services


Note: This bundle is currently missing Seldon, which will be added soon.
